# Spendability of Currenty
## Citizen Report

I propose using RWOT the Hague to crowd source a international, location based, spendability of currency report. Largely, I mean cash although if people have insights into the spendability of other currencies e.g. BTC, ETH, etc then that might also be interesting.

I bring this up, due to a recent experience I have had in London where despite trying every establishment I visited I have found it incredibly difficult to spend the cash in my wallet. 

This transition away from phyiscal, untraceable, currency towards electronically mediated and correlatable transactions has undoubtably been accelerated by the COVID pandemic. And certainly it brings a lot of benefits, e.g. ease of use, security of transactions and reduced risk to retailers. However, it is my feeling we should be cautious about the trend towards the exclusion of cash as a viable means of exchange. 

So this is a proposal to take the pulse of this transition, using our own experience of transacting in our local context. If you want to participate, here is what I propose.

1. Withdraw a reasonable chunk of cash in your local currency. E.g. 50 - 100. Then before reaching for your card, try to spend your cash over a weekend wherever you need to transact.
2. Observe this interactions with the aim of writing a short paragraph summary of your experience.
3. Submit a spendability of currency report.

Suggested report template:

* Location (City / Country)
* Currency 
* Spendability rating (out of 10, where 0 is unspendable and 10 is accepted easily everywhere) 
* Observations

An example of mine from my experiences over a weekend in London would be as follows:

* London / United Kingdom
* GBP (cash)
* Spendability rating: 3 / 10
* Observations: It seems in London, cash is not king. Over a weekend I attempted to spend Â£60 pounds whilst strolling around the capital on a sunny weekend. I didn't manage to spend any, despite attempting to at over 5 cafe/bar/food type establishments. The only place I have found that I can reliably spend cash is at a supermarket (or likely a drug dealer). It seems that card has become the default, and often only payment option available. 
 
Just an idea, but might be interesting if we get a decent sample size. Then the final paper could be a compilation of individual reports with added commentary, insights and concerns. Something like this.
