# Validation - The Missing Link

By Rieks Joosten <rieks.joosten@tno.nl>

A [Verifiable Credential (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential), or better perhaps, a [Presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-presentations) is requested by a particular [party](https://trustoverip.github.io/essiflab/glossary#party) for the purpose of processing the data it contains, e.g. for making some kind of a decision and/or doing computations. Obviously, such data must come with a particular syntax and semantics in order to be processable. But that is nog enough.

Syntax and semantics are like a television: they describe the specifications (pixels, size, etc.) of a product, and as such are indispensible. However, when you want to buy one, it is also about the source of it all, the party that is trying to sell you this, the price, the terms of use, guarantees and the like. These things determine where (from whom) you will obtain the television.

The [VC spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) limits itself
