## Abstract

The Data Exchange Agreemeent provides a suit of agreements that enable automated agreement handling for data exchange between a Data Source (DS) and Data Using Service (DUS). It helps organisations to continue leveraging their data assets while being transparent and legitimate in their data usage. Automated agreement handling is a requisite for a scalable and regulatory-compliant data marketplace.. It also provides individuals control over how their data is used and exchanged.

This RWOT paper provides information on how any organisation can leverage data using SSI and non-SSI protocols while being lawful, scalable and trustworthy.

## Introduction

Data is the ​critical currency of an advanced digital economy, and trust is fundamental for continuous access to personal data. An adequate governance framework is essential to build the requisite trust and must involve, at the very least, the following actors:

- **Individuals**, who can manage their preferences and follow their data, should know who is consuming what, when and why.

- **Organisations**, which are either a DS or a DUS, should be able to leverage personal data and gain access to the right quality data, provided that:

   - they offer adequate transparency for individuals to trust them.
   - their data usage is compliant with the relevant data protection and privacy regulations which they can prove if requested.

- **Auditors**, who can independently prove fair data usage via independent audit mechanisms, can be used by organisations and individuals to ​verify the legitimacy of their claims in any legal dispute concerning the use or misuse of data.

Any organisation undergoing digital transformation needs to ensure that it can cater to the above, so individuals continue to say “yes” to sharing their data. Initiatives like **MyData Operator** and the proposed EU Data Governance Act point to the need for **data intermediaries** ​to enable the above for individuals and businesses.

Data exchange agreement suit aim to enhance data governance to ​increase transparency and authenticity as ​critical elements for digital trust. This paper describes how the key actors above can capture, view or disclose the provenance trail of a personal data exchange transaction​,​ starting with ​creating data disclosure agreements during any such data exchanges. It also specifies how a DS can define rules for data processing (to demonstrate regulatory compliance etc.) in a data exchange transaction.

## Proposal

The paper will provide details on a data exchange landscape and how to achieve auditable, immutable and trustworthy data exhcange that is lawful. 


## Standardisation

The Data Agreement schema is standardised as part of ISO 27560 and driven via DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation) Data Agreement WG [13]. The DIF workgroup will further investigate standardising the DID:mydata introduced as part of the Automated Data Agreement project by iGrant.io (Sweden).
