# eSSIF-Lab: Towards a European SSI ecosystem

(Paper to be completed during RWOT 2022, Den Haag, 26-30 September 2022)

## Summary

eSSIF-Lab is a 7 M€, three-year (2019-2022), European-Commission-funded program that has been sponsoring start-ups, SMEs and innovators to develop open-source SSI components, SSI products and SSI services. A total of 54 eSSIF-Lab subgrantees has developed a wide variety of SSI solutions, which have been  interop-tested with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees and innovators outside the program, which have been contributed to standardisation in W3C, Aries, DIF, OIDC and other, and which have been commercially deployed in the European market. Many eSSIF-Lab subgrantees have managed to secure external investments, and a few have even been involved in mergers & acquisitions. Many of the eSSIF-Lab outputs are available in the form of well-documented open-source code, ready for deployment. This includes SSI wallet infrastructure, SDKs for SSI wallets, SSI-standards-compliant API libraries, tooling for SSI trust infrastructure, tooling for SSI-based mandating/delegation and several other. Other eSSIF-Lab outputs are commercial propositions including SSI applications for educational credentials, for the health sector, for e-government and other.

This RWOT paper provides a selection of impactful eSSIF-Lab subgrantee projects, and provides pointers how to download or use these results for your own SSI projects.

## 1. Introduction: SSI and eSSIF-Lab

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) does not need any introduction in the context of RWOT [1]. People are encouraged to read primers on SSI e.g. here: [2], [3], [4], [5].

eSSIF-Lab [6] (European Self-Sovereign-Identity-Framework Laboratory) is part of of the Next Generation Internet (NGI) programme, organised by the European Commission in the context of the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Actions [7] funding. eSSIF-Lab was partly modeled after the Silicon Valley Innovation Programme [8] (SVIP) of the American Deparment of Homeland Services. **<u>*< ... more about eSSIF-Lab, its consortium, its goverance, budgets, numbers, etcetera ... >*</u>**
